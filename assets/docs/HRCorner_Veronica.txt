Happy November!

With our growing list of programs, we know it can be tricky to keep track of all the different websites and logins. To make things easier, I’ve put together a Username and Password Cheat Sheet for all HR-related platforms. You’ll find login details for:
• The 401(k) website, Ascensus (formally known as Newport Group)
• Health insurance portals (I’ve included all three providers, as they vary by office)
• The Podium website
• Paycor
• Guardian
• SFC Newsletter

Reminder: This is also a great time to select paperless delivery for your W-2 and 1095 forms in Paycor. Most employees access their W-2 online in early January—well before the paper copies arrive—so going paperless can make things faster and more convenient. Of course, the choice is yours!

How to Choose PAPERLESS W-2 and 1095 Delivery in Paycor
1. Log in: Visit www.paycor.com and sign in using your employee credentials.
2. Select “Pay & Taxes” and hit the dropdown button.
3. Open “Paperless Options”
4. Choose Paperless: Check the boxes next to W-2 and 1095-C to receive them electronically.
5. Review and Sign: Read the disclosure, then click Sign & Continue to confirm your selection.
