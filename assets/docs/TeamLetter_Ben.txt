As we roll into November, I want to take a moment to celebrate what we’ve accomplished together, and set our sights on the opportunities ahead.  We closed out Q3 ahead of goal for both sales an	d invoice totals, not only for the quarter but year-to-date as well! That’s a tremendous accomplishment — especially given how challenging the residential market has been this year. The strength of our commercial business, the grit of our teams, and our commitment to doing it right have made the difference.
Now we’re off to a strong start in Q4, with sales running ahead of goal and charges only slightly behind. The effort I’m seeing at every level makes me proud to be part of this team.

We’re excited to introduce our new company tagline: 

            “Built right. Backed by values. Trusted for generations.” 
 
We believe this perfectly embodies our mission, vision, and values — and communicates them in a way that resonates deeply with our customers. It reflects who we are, what we stand for, and the lasting value people experience when they choose Seegars Fence Company. Our goal is that every customer sees not just a fence, but a promise — one built right, backed by values, and trusted for generations to come.

I came across a quote recently that really stuck with me: “Stop waiting to feel ready. Ready is not a feeling — it’s a mindset.” That’s a powerful reminder that success doesn’t come when the conditions are perfect; it comes when we decide to move forward with faith and determination.  Here are a few verses that reinforce this mentality: 
• “Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and He will establish your plans.” - Proverbs 16:3  
• “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” – Joshua 1:9
• “Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.” – Galatians 6:9

Each verse reminds us that the path forward requires courage, faith, and steady hands — qualities that this team demonstrates every day.

As we enter this season of football, fall weather, and Thanksgiving, let’s carry that “ready mindset” into every job, every estimate, and every interaction. Be thankful for the opportunities before us, the people beside us, and the work we get to do together.  We’ve proven that when we stay focused on our values and keep pushing forward — no matter how tough the market — we win together. Let’s finish 2025 strong and keep changing the world one linear foot at a time.

Best,

Ben
