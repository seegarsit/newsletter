A request form for the custom fab estimators:

I realize it’s easy to just grab the Misc Custom Quote Form and go.  But that is not always going to relay all the relevant information for us to do the estimation, or more importantly to get the fabrications built properly.   

In the example below, I know we’re quoting an ornamental gate, that has previously been quoted at a different height.   But we don’t have a proper form to send to the floor for the fabricators to build by.   Do they want standard deductions? Std Bottom or Flush? An Orn. Alum Gate form Answers those questions

In the next example, we have a decking gate, a SQ Gate Frame form would be the correct form below.  Instead, we have a complete sheet from the plans section, which fails to include the gate height.

Thank you for simplifying issues on our end to hopefully get you the pricing faster and the fabrications with a few mistakes as possible.
