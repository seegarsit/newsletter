              <p>Team,</p>
              <p>
                As we roll into November, I want to celebrate what we’ve accomplished together and set
                our sights on the opportunities ahead. We closed out Q3 ahead of goal for both sales and
                invoices — not only for the quarter but year-to-date as well. That’s a tremendous
                accomplishment, especially given how challenging the residential market has been this
                year. The strength of our commercial business, the grit of our teams, and our commitment
                to doing it right have made the difference. Now we’re off to a strong start in Q4, with
                sales running ahead of goal and charges only slightly behind. The effort I’m seeing at
                every level makes me proud to be part of this team.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re excited to introduce our new company tagline:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="callout callout--center">
                “Built right. Backed by values. Trusted for generations.”
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe this perfectly embodies our mission, vision, and values — and communicates
                them in a way that resonates deeply with our customers. It reflects who we are, what we
                stand for, and the lasting value people experience when they choose Seegars Fence
                Company. Our goal is that every customer sees not just a fence, but a promise — one built
                right, backed by values, and trusted for generations to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                I came across a quote recently that really stuck with me: “Stop waiting to feel ready.
                Ready is not a feeling — it’s a mindset.” That’s a powerful reminder that success doesn’t
                come when the conditions are perfect; it comes when we decide to move forward with faith
                and determination. Here are a few verses that reinforce this mentality:
              </p>
              <ul class="accent-list">
                <li>“Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and He will establish your plans.” — Proverbs 16:3</li>
                <li>“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” — Joshua 1:9</li>
                <li>“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.” — Galatians 6:9</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each verse reminds us that the path forward requires courage, faith, and steady hands —
                qualities that this team demonstrates every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we enter this season of football, fall weather, and Thanksgiving, let’s carry that
                “ready mindset” into every job, every estimate, and every interaction. Be thankful for the
                opportunities before us, the people beside us, and the work we get to do together. We’ve
                proven that when we stay focused on our values and keep pushing forward — no matter how
                tough the market — we win together. Let’s finish 2025 strong and keep changing the world
                one linear foot at a time.

              <p>
                Early next Sunday morning most of those in the United States will turn their clocks back
                one hour for the end of Daylight-Saving Time. Most of us think: “Fantastic! I get another
                hour of sleep”; and yes, you will. However, there is a huge difference between the
                “society clock” and the “biological clock” we all work from. During such time changes there
                is statistically an increase in safety incidents.
              </p>
              <div class="safety-grid">
                <div class="safety-card">
                  <p>
                    With the end of daylight savings time comes an increase of darkness around the time of
                    rush hour, when traffic is at a peak, and many are making our way home from work.
                    Drivers aren’t used to the decreased visibility – nor are pedestrians, who might take
                    chances crossing roads when they shouldn’t.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="safety-card">
                  <p>
                    Pedestrians walking around at dusk are nearly three times more likely to be struck and
                    killed by cars in the days following the end of daylight-saving time than just before
                    the time change. A study of seven years of nationwide traffic fatalities were
                    conducted at Carnegie Mellon University, calculating the risk per mile walked for
                    pedestrians. The study found that the per-mile risk jumps 186 percent from October to
                    November.
                  </p>

                <p>
                  The National Road Safety Foundation (NRSF) has done studies proving that auto accidents
                  increase after the clocks fall back an hour. Besides the lack of visibility, the NRSF
                  notes that commuting in the dark can also make drivers drowsier than usual. According to
                  some health studies, changes in waking time coupled with the earlier onset of darkness
                  throws off our internal clocks. This increases driving risks, primarily because in our
                  24/7 society, we have a fundamental problem of already being sleep deprived.

                The end of daylight-saving time can leave many feeling fatigued, which can pose safety
                risks both at home and in the workplace. Some things to keep in mind when switching back to
                standard time are:

                  <h3>Fatigue</h3>
                  <p>
                    Studies suggest that it takes people who work traditional hours several days to fully
                    readjust their sleep schedule after the time change. While it may seem a welcome gift
                    to get an extra hour of sleep as opposed to losing an hour in the spring, there is a
                    physiological consequence to changing our clocks. Don’t be surprised if you feel a bit
                    sluggish during the first week or so of November.

                  <p>
                    Evidence suggests that time changes increase safety problems both at work and at home.
                    Just being aware of the increased risk of accidents in the period immediately
                    following the time change may help you stay alert. Try to avoid building up a sleep
                    debt in the days before the change.

                Safety professionals have long used the start and end of daylight-saving time as reminders
                for performing recurring safety tasks. Use the occasion of setting your clocks back as a
                cue to:
              </p>
              <ul class="safety-task-list">
                <li>
                  Check and replace the batteries in your smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) alarms. Ensure
                  they are working properly and replace the batteries. As the cold sets in and many start
                  up their gas-fired furnaces, fireplaces, portable unit heaters and the like for the first
                  time, carbon monoxide poisoning risks increase dramatically during this time of year.
                  Replace any smoke alarm unit that is older than 10 years. Replace any CO alarm unit that
                  is older than 5 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prepare a winter emergency kit for your automobile. Such kits can be a lifesaver if you
                  are stuck out in bad weather while driving. They should include items such as warm
                  clothes, blanket, flashlight, batteries, water, non-perishable snacks, shovel, flares,
                  reflective hazard triangle, jumper cables, cat litter or sand for traction, ski hat and
                  gloves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check to see if your fire extinguishers need recharging. Check the small gauge at the top
                  of the extinguisher. If the needle in that gauge is in the green, chances are, the
                  extinguisher is okay. If it is in the red, you need to have the extinguisher recharged.

                I realize it’s easy to just grab the Misc Custom Quote Form and go, but that form doesn’t
                always include all the details we need — either to estimate accurately or, more
                importantly, to ensure the fabrication is built correctly.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the example below, we’re quoting an ornamental gate that was previously quoted at a
                different height. However, we don’t have a proper form to send to the floor for the
                fabricators to build from. Key details are missing — for instance:
              </p>
              <div class="fab-checklist">
                <div class="fab-note">Should standard deductions be applied?</div>
                <div class="fab-note">Should it have a standard bottom or be flush?</div>
              </div>
              <p>
                The Ornamental Aluminum Gate Form answers those questions and provides the information the
                fabrication team needs to build it right the first time.

                In the next example, we have a decking gate. The correct form to use here would be the SQ
                Gate Frame Form shown below. Instead, a full sheet from the plans section was submitted —
                but it doesn’t include the gate height.
