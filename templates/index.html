              <p>
                As we roll into November, I want to celebrate what we’ve accomplished together and set
                our sights on the opportunities ahead. We closed out Q3 ahead of goal for both sales and
                invoices — not only for the quarter but year-to-date as well. That’s a tremendous
                accomplishment, especially given how challenging the residential market has been this
                year. The strength of our commercial business, the grit of our teams, and our commitment
                to doing it right have made the difference. Now we’re off to a strong start in Q4, with
                sales running ahead of goal and charges only slightly behind. The effort I’m seeing at
                every level makes me proud to be part of this team.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re excited to introduce our new company tagline:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="callout callout--center">
                “Built right. Backed by values. Trusted for generations.”
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe this perfectly embodies our mission, vision, and values — and communicates
                them in a way that resonates deeply with our customers. It reflects who we are, what we
                stand for, and the lasting value people experience when they choose Seegars Fence
                Company. Our goal is that every customer sees not just a fence, but a promise — one built
                right, backed by values, and trusted for generations to come.
              </p>
              <p>
                I came across a quote recently that really stuck with me: “Stop waiting to feel ready.
                Ready is not a feeling — it’s a mindset.” That’s a powerful reminder that success doesn’t
                come when the conditions are perfect; it comes when we decide to move forward with faith
                and determination. Here are a few verses that reinforce this mentality:
              </p>
              <ul class="accent-list">
                <li>“Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and He will establish your plans.” — Proverbs 16:3</li>
                <li>“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” — Joshua 1:9</li>
                <li>“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.” — Galatians 6:9</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each verse reminds us that the path forward requires courage, faith, and steady hands —
                qualities that this team demonstrates every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we enter this season of football, fall weather, and Thanksgiving, let’s carry that
                “ready mindset” into every job, every estimate, and every interaction. Be thankful for the
                opportunities before us, the people beside us, and the work we get to do together. We’ve
                proven that when we stay focused on our values and keep pushing forward — no matter how
                tough the market — we win together. Let’s finish 2025 strong and keep changing the world
                one linear foot at a time.

                behind your project and we will use that information to feature the job online, across
                social media, as well as award submissions. These jobs/stories build credibility, attract
                new customers, and position both you and our company as leaders in quality, innovation, and

              <p>
                Beyond marketing value, these forms help us capture lessons learned and share best
                practices across branches, strengthening our collective performance. They give us the

                Reminder: This is also a great time to select paperless delivery for your W-2 and 1095
                forms in Paycor. Most employees access their W-2 online in early January—well before the
                paper copies arrive—so going paperless can make things faster and more convenient. Of
                course, the choice is yours!
              </p>

                This Sunday marks the end of Daylight Saving Time — don’t forget to turn your clocks back
                one hour! While the extra sleep is nice, the time change can increase the risk of fatigue
                and accidents both on the road and at work.
              </p>
              <p>
                As evening darkness arrives earlier, visibility decreases right around rush hour. Studies
                show a spike in traffic accidents and pedestrian injuries in the days following the switch.
                The change also disrupts our sleep schedules, leaving many people drowsier than usual.
              </p>
              <p>Keep these safety tips in mind as we “fall back”:</p>
              <ul class="safety-reminders">
                <li>
                  <strong>Stay alert on the road.</strong> Watch for pedestrians and adjust to darker evening commutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Check smoke and CO alarms.</strong> Replace batteries and outdated units (smoke alarms older than 10
                  years, CO alarms older than 5).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prepare your vehicle.</strong> Stock a winter emergency kit with warm clothing, snacks, a flashlight,
                  and jumper cables.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Inspect fire extinguishers.</strong> Make sure the gauge is in the green zone.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A little preparation and awareness go a long way in keeping everyone safe this season.

              <p>
                I realize it’s easy to just grab the Misc Custom Quote Form and go, but that form doesn’t
                always include all the details we need — either to estimate accurately or, more
                importantly, to ensure the fabrication is built correctly.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the example below, we’re quoting an ornamental gate that was previously quoted at a
                different height. However, we don’t have a proper form to send to the floor for the
                fabricators to build from. Key details are missing — for instance:
              </p>
              <div class="fab-checklist">
                <div class="fab-note">Should standard deductions be applied?</div>
                <div class="fab-note">Should it have a standard bottom or be flush?</div>
              </div>
              <p>
                The Ornamental Aluminum Gate Form answers those questions and provides the information the
                fabrication team needs to build it right the first time.
              </p>
              <div class="fab-actions">
                <button
                  class="button button--ghost"

              <p>
                In the next example, we have a decking gate. The correct form to use here would be the SQ
                Gate Frame Form shown below. Instead, a full sheet from the plans section was submitted —
                but it doesn’t include the gate height.
